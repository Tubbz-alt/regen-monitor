# Upgrade Block Checker

This checks for the expected upgrade time given a block height.

There are two functions here that can be reused, but this is currently
tied to the Regen Amazonas update.

## Usage

First set up with `yarn install`

Then get a message with `yarn -s block`

Output should look something like:
`Upgrade at block 1722050 will occur approximately Thu, 26 Sep 2019 12:58:56 GMT`
